## ⚙️ Configuration

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|

## 💬 Real-time Chat

QuendAward includes a real-time chat system powered by MQTT over WebSockets. Messages are delivered instantly between operators — no page refresh needed.

### How it works

```
Browser A ──(MQTT/WS)──► Mosquitto Broker ──(MQTT/WS)──► Browser B
                                │
                         Python subscriber ──► SQLite (history)
```

- **Mosquitto** MQTT broker runs as a Docker sidecar, handling pub/sub routing
- **mqtt.js** in the browser connects via WebSocket for instant message delivery
- A **Python MQTT subscriber** thread persists messages to SQLite for chat history
- Chat rooms are **per-award** — each special callsign has its own channel

### Enabling chat

Set the `MQTT_WS_URL` environment variable to enable the chat tab:

```bash
# In .env
MQTT_WS_URL=wss://yourdomain.com/mqtt
```

When `MQTT_WS_URL` is not set, the chat tab is hidden and no MQTT connections are made. The nginx config included in the standalone deployment already proxies `/mqtt` to Mosquitto's WebSocket port.

## 📡 DX Cluster Spotting

Operators can send spots to a DX Cluster node directly from the activity dashboard, announcing that a special callsign is active on a specific frequency.

### How it works

1. An operator **blocks a band/mode** on the heatmap (spotting requires an active block)
2. The **DX Cluster Spot** section appears below the heatmap with band/mode autofilled from the block
3. The operator enters the **spotted callsign**, **frequency**, and an optional **comment**
4. QuendAward connects to the configured DX Cluster node via Telnet and sends the spot command

```
DX de EA1RFI:    14025.0  EG90IARU     QRV CW                        1423Z
     └─ cluster login      └─ spotted    └─ comment
```

### Configuration

Set the following environment variables to enable spotting:

```bash
# In .env
DX_CLUSTER_HOST=dxfun.com
DX_CLUSTER_PORT=8000
DX_CLUSTER_CALLSIGN=EA1RFI
DX_CLUSTER_PASSWORD=           # Only if the cluster requires authentication
```

When `DX_CLUSTER_HOST` is not set, the send button shows a configuration error. The spot section is always visible but requires an active block to use. Clusters that require password authentication after the callsign login are supported via the optional `DX_CLUSTER_PASSWORD` variable.
